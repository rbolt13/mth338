# W1: Jan. 4th, 2022

## Intro 

- Adjunct at PSU and did research on geometry 

- starting from the ground up 

- for the first 6 - 7 we are going to take Euclids rules 

- then  focus on non-euclidean geometry 

This course is about : 

- building geometry from the ground up 

- explaining things with pictures

- understanding how to start from nothing and get something 

- how to use geometry 

- write proofs (mostly writing in paragraphs), abd build confidence in geometric proofs. 

Canvas 

- Boyce Notes will be our main texts 

  - Boyce has taught course for years and has made notes as up to date as possible. 
  
- Will recommend sections or problems from Alfrik and Barsamian

Calendar 

- Homework is due on Friday 

- Homework will always be based on previous week's lessons 

- Participation forms due Monday. 

- Quiz's are take home 

  - Due end of week 3 (will be posted at the end of next week)
  
    - Opportunity to present math (video, power point, ect.)
    
  - Due end of week 8
  
- For midterm and final we can proctor online or take in person. Will send an email before hand. 

Today 

- various universities never have the same geometry class 

- Boyce was apart of research group that studies how geometry fits into college curriculum. 

- class will end early (5:30) so we can fill out form that we will fill out at the end of the term. 

  - this is a "before" form, so it is okay that you dont know things
  
## Axioms 

> **Axioms** : ground rules that build on 

Axiom 1 : 4 is special 

Axiom 2 : 3 is not special 

> **model** : Definition of terms that fits rules.

Q : if the word special meant even would this model make sense? 

A : Yes. 

Q : what if special = odd 

A : No. 

Q : what if special = perfect square 

A : Yes.  

Breakout Groups : 

Axiom 1 : 4 is special 

Axiom 2 : 3 is not special

Axiom 3 : If x is special, x-1 is not special.

A. special = even , is this still true 

B. special = square 

Q : Do these models still work? 

B does not work with zero as a square. 

# W1: Jan. 6th, 2022

Goal of course : Use axioms to prove theorems. 

Due Monday : Participation Form

Homework #1 Due next Friday 

Note on Homework #2 : "Why" usually means "proof"  but this time a sentence or two explantion is good. (But: be careful with examples)

Example : Why are all negative numbers smaller than all positive numbers? 

(a) If a number is negative its < 0

(b) Well, -2 < 3

Last time : Euclid 300 BCE

### First 3 axioms 

(1) Two $\underline{\text{points}}$ determine every $\underline{\text{line}}$. Every line contains at least 2 points and there exists three non-$\underline{\text{collinear}}$ points. 

- will need to understand underlined terms, by a model or definition of these terms. 

(2) If B is $\underline{\text{between}}$ A and C, A, B, C are $\underline{\text{collinear}}$. If A, B, C are $\underline{\text{collinear}}$, exactly one of these $\underline{\text{points}}$ is between the other two. 

(3) Points of $\underline{\text{intersection}}$ exist if, when constructed in the $\underline{\text{plane}}$, the $\underline{\text{lines}}$ or $\underline{\text{circles}}$ necessarily cross. 

Practice : "between"

![](img/img2.png)

**$\underline{\text{Collinear}}$** : A, B, C are collinear if 1 point lies on the $\underline{\text{line}}$ connecting the other 2. 

Q : What is the problem with the picture on the right? 

- A, C, B is not collinear, so B is not between. 

## Break-out Groups : Definitions 

Group 1 : A point is a coordinate in space. 

Group 2 : circle is a line segement with a fixed pt around center that rotates, and has a radius. 

Group 3 : line segment has end points A and B and all points that are both between and collinear. 

- do we need collinear if we say between? no, because its in our definition of between  

Group 3 : Endpoints are points on line segment that aren't between any other 2 points. 

Will formalize definitions these definitions later : point, straight, line, circle, radius, center, line segment, endpoint 

## Part Conjectures and Conditional Statements

Workflow : Start with axioms 

$\rightarrow$ make conjecture (un-proven maybe theorem). 

$\rightarrow$ theorem is conjecture once it's "proved".

$\underline{\text{Conditional Statement}}$ : If X then Y. 

- X is the hypothesis 

- Y is conclusion 

- Ex: If X is an even number then x-1 is an odd number. 

  - Hypothesis : "x is even"
  
  - Conclusion : "x-1 is an odd number"

$\rightarrow$ Assign "truth values"

- If X then Y $\rightarrow$ T

## List of Vocabularly going with conditional statements

1. X $\rightarrow$ not X is $\underline{\text{negation}}$

- Ex: X : x is even, not X : x is not even. 

- Ex: X : all cats are orange, not X : not all cats are orange

  - not X : at least 1 cat is not orange
  
- Ex: X : If it is cloudy, then it is raining, not X : It can be both cloudy and not raining. 

**If X then Y** 

Ex: X : If Anne is a beagle then Anne is a dog. (True)

1. Converse : If Y then X.  

- Converse of X : If Anne is a dog, then Anne is a beagle. (False)

2. Contrapositive : If not Y, then not X. 

- Contrapositive of X : If Anne is not a dog, then Anne is not a beagle. (True)

- A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning they have the same truth value (both true or both false). 

3. Inverse : If not X then not Y. 

- Inverse of X : If Anne is not a beagal, then Anne is not a dog. (False)

- The inverse is the contrapositive of the converse $\rightarrow$ logically equivalent. 

Statement $\Leftrightarrow$ Contrapositive 

Converse $\Leftrightarrow$ Inverse 

## Biconditional: X if and only if y

Ex : If x is an even number then x-1 is an odd number. (True)

Contrapositive : If x-1 is not odd, x is not even. (True)

Converse : If x-1 is odd, x is even. (True)

Inverse : If X is not even, x-1 is not odd. (True)

Ex : X is even if and only if x-1 is odd. 

- x is even iff x-1 is odd. 

- $x\text{ is even}\Leftrightarrow x-1\text{ is odd}$

## Logic : Organizing "truth values"

**Truth Table** 

```{r tuth table, echo=F, message=F}
x <- c("T","F")
negation_not_x <- c("F","T")
truth_table <- data.frame(x,negation_not_x)  %>% 
  kable(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
truth_table
```

```{r truth table 1, echo=F, message=F}
x <- c("T","T", "F", "F")
y <- c("T","F","T","F")
if_x_then_y <- c("T","F","T","T")
truth_table_2 <- data.frame(x,y,if_x_then_y) %>% 
  kable(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
truth_table_2
```

- "If x is true then y is true"

Homework 

```{r truth table 2, echo=F, message=F}
x <- c("T","T", "F", "F")
y <- c("T","F","T","F")
if_x_or_y <- c("T","F","F","F")
if_x_and_y <- c("T","T","T","F")
truth_table_3 <- data.frame(x,y,if_x_or_y, if_x_and_y) %>% 
  kable(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
truth_table_3
```

Inclusive vs. exclusive 

- In math we always mean inclusive, "or both"

- Common language is exclusive, "one or the other"

- Or always means both

## Lets try a Proof

Conjecture : If x is an even number then x-1 is an odd number. 

Need : 

  Definition : 
  
    even = x is even if x/2 is an integer.
    
    odd = x is odd if x/2 is not an integer.
    
    integer = positive, negative whole numebrs, and 0. (no decimals or fractions). 
    
If x (start) then y (end). 

**Table**

```{r first proof, echo=F, message=F}
Statement <- c("Suppose x is even","Then x/2 is an integer of a=x/2","So 2a=x","Then x-1 = 2a-1","So (x-1)/2=(2a-1)/2","(x-1)/2=a-1/2","a-1/2 is not an integer","Then x-1 is odd")
Reason <- c("given assumption","Definition of even.","algebra","algebra","algebra", "algebra","a is an integer", "definition of odd")
proof_table <- data.frame(Statement, Reason) %>% 
  kable(align = "c") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
proof_table 
```

**Paragraph**

Suppose x is even. 

Then by the definition $a=\frac{x}{2}$ is an integer. 

So $2a=x$.

Then $x-1=2a-1$ is odd. 

So $\frac{x-1}{2}=\frac{2a-1}{2}=a-\frac{1}{2}$

But a is an integer. 

So $a-\frac{1}{2}$ is not an integer.

Then x-1 is odd, by definition.

Another name for proving contrapositive is proving by way of contradiction. 

Next week this will be a geometry class. 

# W2D3 : Jan. 11th, 2022

## Homework 1 Questions 

1. Truth table questions, filling in the rest of the table. 

2. b. In the future "why" means proof, but here a few sentences of explanation is fine. 

4. Question with models 

- due on Friday 

- week 1 participation form was due on Monday 

## Euclid Elements 

### Definitions 

Def.1: A _point_ is that which has no part.

- can't be broken up, has no sides 

Def.2: A _line_ is breathless length. 

- 1 dimensions, no width 

- nothing in this definition implies a line must be straight, meaning a line can be curvy 

- in this class when we say line, we really mean straight line. 

Def.3: The end of a line are _points_. 

Def.4: A _straight line_ is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself.

- line is staying on same level as points 

Def.5: A _surface_ is that which has length and breadth only. 

- 2 dimensions, can have length and width 

Def.6: The edges of a surface are lines. 

Def.7: A _plane surface_ is a surface which lies evenly with the straight lines on itself. 

Def.8: A _plane angle_ is the inclination to one another of two lines in a plane which meet one another and do not lie in a straight line. 

- going in two directions 

Def.15: A _circle_ is a plane figure contained by one line such that all the straight lines falling upon it from one point among those lying within the figure equal one another. 

- talking about radius 

### Postulates (Axioms)

[Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/geometry)

P.1: To draw a straight line from any point to any point.

![](img/img3.png)

P.2: To produce a finite straight line continuously in a straight line. 

![](img/img4.png)

P.3: To describe a circle with any center and radius. 

![](img/img5.png)

P.4: That all right angles equal one another. 

![](img/img6.png)

P.5: That, if straight line falling on two straight lines makes the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles. 

![](img/img7.png)

## Notation 

Line segment between A, B : 

- $\overline{AB}$ , line segment 

- $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ , infinite line 

- $\overrightarrow{AB}$ , ray that is infinite in one direction 

Length of $\overline{AB}$ is AB. 

## Axioms of Length 

Each segment $\overline{AB}$ can be assigned a positive number called its lenght AB such that 

1. Length of the unit segment is 1. 

2. AB = BA. 

3. If B is between A and C then AB+BC=AC

4. $\exists$ a point m between A ,B such that Am=mB, and call m the midpoint. 

### Conjecture

$Am=\frac{1}{2}AB$, if n is the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$. 

By axiom (3) $AB=Am+mB$. 

By axiom (4) $AB=Am+Am$. 

Algebra $AB=2Am\Rightarrow Am=\frac{AB}{2}$. 

## Angles

![](img/img8.png)

Ray: starts and continues forever 

Vertex: point where two lines connect 

Angles: inclination of two lines 

- angle size will be small if lines point in simialr direction, and large if point in opposite directions 

- $\angle ABC$

![](img/img9.png)

"Straight Angle"  is $180^\circ$.

"Right Angle" is half of a straight line.

"Acute" is less than a right angle. 

"Abtuse" bigger than a right angle. 

- needs to be between straight angle and right (between $180^\circ$ and $90^\circ$)

"Minor Angle" is smaller than a straight angle. 

"Major Angle" is larger than a straight angle.
