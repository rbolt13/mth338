## Dilation 

Pick a center P, and "scaling factor" k. 

### Three cases 

for k>0

- k > 1 , expanding 

- k < 1 , shrinking 

- k = 1 nothing 

Q goes to $Q'$ on $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ where $\overline{PQ'}=k\overline{PQ}$.

- stays on same ray 

### Does Dilation Change Angles

No. When you scale from a center your angles stay the same (with congruent measures). 

Morale: Scale / Dilate using vertex of angle as center, angles don't change. 

## Similar

Two figures are similar if one can be superimposed on the other by a dilation and then an isometry. 

When things are similar then they are also proportional 

Notation: $\sim$

### Theorem: (AA Similarty Theorem)

If $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ satisfy 

- $\angle ABC\cong \angle DEF$ and 

- $\angle BCA\cong \angle EFD$

Then $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$
  
Note: $\angle CAB\cong \angle FDE$ is automatically true (AAA)

### Proof

Let ABC and DEF be triangles with $\angle BAC \cong \angle EDF$.

First: AB, DE > 0 

Apply dilation to $\triangle ABC$

- center = A

(note math is easier if you pick a point on the triangle ABC)

- scale factor = $k=\frac{DE}{AB}$

A'= A (doesn't move if it is the center)

B'=  $\rightarrow$ $AB'=k\cdot AB=DE$

Plan: If $\triangle A'B'C'\cong\triangle DEF$ then $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$. 
![](img/img71.png)

We think $\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\overline{B'C'}$ so $\angle AB'C'\cong \angle ABC$ (corresponding). 

By ASA we know $\triangle A'B'C'\cong\triangle DEF$, therefore $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$.

## Theorem: SAS Similarity Theorem

If $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ satisy 

- $\angle CAB\cong \angle FDE$ and 

- $\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{AC}{DF}$

then $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$. 

Proof: 

1. Dilation (pick center k)

2. Congruence Theorem 

Imagine a center point P, and two points A and B. 

It makes sense that if you dilate A to A' and B to B' then $\angle ABC\cong \angle A'PB'$ because they are stayingon the same rays. 

Similarly we can say $\angle PBA\cong \angle PB'A'$. 

Imagine we did a translation moving A, B by $\overrightarrow{BB'}$. 

- P stays on $\overleftrightarrow{BB'}$

We know that A'' is from the translation, and we know that that is an isometry which preserves angle and length. Therefore then angles are the same.

## Circles 

(Section 6 of Boyce notes)

**Circle:** center, radius 

Points on circle have distance r from the center point O. 

**Unit Circle:** radius length 1.

**Arc:** a connected subset of the points on circle.

**Chord:** line segment connecting 2 points on circle. 

**Central Angle:** vertex is center of circle, rays intersect in 2 different points.

![](img/img72.png)

$\angle HGI$ is a central angle. 

**Inscribed Angles** vertex is on circle, rays intersect circle in 2 points. 

![](img/img73.png)

$\angle LKM$ is an inscribed angle 

**Inscribed:** verities on circle. 

For an inscribed square, all four points of a square are on the circle.

**Tangent Line:** Line that intersects circle at only 1 point. 

**Radian:** measure of the central angle in a unit circle with arc length of 1. 

There will be a bonus opportunity involving radians. 

## Circle Questions 

Pick 2 points A and B on a circle. 

![](img/img74.png)

1. How many (minor) central angles go through A, B? 

      One. 
      
![](img/img75.png)

2. How many inscribed angles go through A B? 

      A lot. 
      
      
3. Relationship between minor angle and inscribed angle? 

    The minor angle is twice the size of the inscribed angle.

### Extra Credit 

Figure out whats wrong with the theorem below and correct it: 

**Inscribed Angles Theorem** Let P, A and B be points on a circle with cnter 0, and let Q be a point on the circle that is not an arc APB. Then $\angle APC$ is one half the measure of the arc AQB. 

Note: you need to talk about length too, not just talk about angles.

### Homework 4 

Will allow corrections on HW 4 up until next Wednesday. 

Interesting strategy for 1 was to have case 1: right triangle (only 1 rectangle), case 2: general triangle (has two right triangles within it). 

This is a useful proof strategy. 

If you are using that the bisectors or a rhombus are perpendicular you need to state where we proved that in class or in another homework. 

### Circle Theorem

![](img/img77.png)

Conjecture: $m\angle AOB= 2 m\angle APB$

### (6.1) Inscribed Angle Theorem

![](img/img78.png)

Suppose A , B on a circle with center O and P is a point on a circle not in interior of $\angle AOB$ then $m\angle AOB=2m\angle APB$ (central = 2 inscribed)

**Case 1:** Right Central Angle 

![](img/img79.png)

The radius of the circle forms triangles with the same side lengths, because the sides are the radius (which remains the same). So, $\overline{AO}=\overline{BO}=\overline{PO}$ and $m\angle APO = m\angle PAO$

We also know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle adds up to $180\circ$, therefore $90^\circ = m\angle AOB= 2m\angle APB$. 

**Case 2:**

![](img/img80.png)

central = $m\angle 1 + m\angle 2$

inscribed = $m\angle 3 + m\angle 4$

From Case 1, we know that $m\angle 1 = 2m\angle 3$ and $m\angle 2 = 2m\angle 4$. 

Therefore $m\angle 1+m\angle 2 = 2m\angle 3+ 2m\angle 4=2(m\angle 3+\angle 4)$. 

Meaning our Central angle is 2 times the inscribed angle. 

**Case 3:** 

![](img/img81.png)

$\angle$ 1: inscribed angle 

$\angle$ 2: central angle 

Notice that $m\angle 3 = 2m\angle 4$. 

Also that $m\angle 2 + m\angle 3$ is a central angle, and $m\angle 1 +m\angle 4$ is inscribed. Meaning then that $m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = 2(m\angle 1 + m\angle 4)$. 

We can then show,

$m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = 2(m\angle 1 + m\angle 4)$

$m\angle 2 + 2m\angle 4 = 2m\angle 1 + 2m\angle 4$

$m\angle 2 = 2 m\angle 1$

Summary

### Corollary

Any two inscribed angles have the same arc on the circle are congruent. 

![](img/img83.png)

### Power of the Point Theorem 1

(6.6) Power of a Point 1. 

![](img/img84.png)

If $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are chords of circle intersecting in x inside circle. Then $AX\cdot XB = CX\cdot XD$. 

Proof: 

![](img/img86.png)

By Inscribed Angle Corollary we see that $\angle 1 \cong \angle 2$ because they share the same arc on the circle. 

By Vertical Angle Theorem we can say that $\angle 3 \cong \angle 4$. 

By Inscribed Angle Theorem $\angle 5 \cong \angle 6$. We can also say that both triangles need to add up to $180\circ$, and therefore they are congruent. 

Therefore by AA Similarity Theorem $\traingle AXD \sim\triangle CXB$.

Since these two triangles are similar we know these two triangles are proportional (Don't know scaling factor k). 

$AX=KCX$

$XD=KXB$

$\frac{AX}{XD}=\frac{kCX}{kXB}=\frac{CX}{XB}$

$\frac{AX}{XD}=\frac{CX}{XB}$

(Get rid of fractions)

$AX\cdot XB=CX\cdot XD$

$\square$

### Power of a point II Theorem

P is outside of a circle, and draw 2 rays from P: 

1 intersecting A and then B

2 intersects C and D. 

Then, $PA\cdot PB= PC\cdot PD$. 

(Note: If P were X insides the circle then this is I)

Hint: Order matters, and drawing triangles will help (see image below). 

![](img/img87.png)

By AA similarity $\triangle PCB \sim \triangle PAD$. 

$\frac{PC}{PB}=\frac{PA}{PD}$ (cross multiply : butterfly diagnolization)

$PA=kPC$ and $PD=kPB$

$PA\cdot PB=PC\cdot PD$. 

$\square$.

This is the end of Euclidean Geometry.
