## Dilation 

Pick a center P, and "scaling factor" k. 

### Three cases 

for k>0

- k > 1 , expanding 

- k < 1 , shrinking 

- k = 1 nothing 

Q goes to $Q'$ on $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ where $\overline{PQ'}=k\overline{PQ}$.

- stays on same ray 

### Does Dilation Change Angles

No. When you scale from a center your angles stay the same (with congruent measures). 

Morale: Scale / Dilate using vertex of angle as center, angles don't change. 

## Similar

Two figures are similar if one can be superimposed on the other by a dilation and then an isometry. 

When things are similar then they are also proportional 

Notation: $\sim$

### Theorem: (AA Similarty Theorem)

If $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ satisfy 

- $\angle ABC\cong \angle DEF$ and 

- $\angle BCA\cong \angle EFD$

Then $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$
  
Note: $\angle CAB\cong \angle FDE$ is automatically true (AAA)

### Proof

Let ABC and DEF be triangles with $\angle BAC \cong \angle EDF$.

First: AB, DE > 0 

Apply dilation to $\triangle ABC$

- center = A

(note math is easier if you pick a point on the triangle ABC)

- scale factor = $k=\frac{DE}{AB}$

A'= A (doesn't move if it is the center)

B'=  $\rightarrow$ $AB'=k\cdot AB=DE$

Plan: If $\triangle A'B'C'\cong\triangle DEF$ then $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$. 
![](img/img71.png)

We think $\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\overline{B'C'}$ so $\angle AB'C'\cong \angle ABC$ (corresponding). 

By ASA we know $\triangle A'B'C'\cong\triangle DEF$, therefore $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$.

## Theorem: SAS Similarity Theorem

If $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ satisy 

- $\angle CAB\cong \angle FDE$ and 

- $\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{AC}{DF}$

then $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$. 

Proof: 

1. Dilation (pick center k)

2. Congruence Theorem 

Imagine a center point P, and two points A and B. 

It makes sense that if you dilate A to A' and B to B' then $\angle ABC\cong \angle A'PB'$ because they are stayingon the same rays. 

Similarly we can say $\angle PBA\cong \angle PB'A'$. 

Imagine we did a translation moving A, B by $\overrightarrow{BB'}$. 

- P stays on $\overleftrightarrow{BB'}$

We know that A'' is from the translation, and we know that that is an isometry which preserves angle and length. Therefore then angles are the same.

## Circles 

(Section 6 of Boyce notes)

**Circle:** center, radius 

Points on circle have distance r from the center point O. 

**Unit Circle:** radius length 1.

**Arc:** a connected subset of the points on circle.

**Chord:** line segment connecting 2 points on circle. 

**Central Angle:** vertex is center of circle, rays intersect in 2 different points.

![](img/img72.png)

$\angle HGI$ is a central angle. 

**Inscribed Angles** vertex is on circle, rays intersect circle in 2 points. 

![](img/img73.png)

$\angle LKM$ is an inscribed angle 

**Inscribed:** verities on circle. 

For an inscribed square, all four points of a square are on the circle.

**Tangent Line:** Line that intersects circle at only 1 point. 

**Radian:** measure of the central angle in a unit circle with arc length of 1. 

There will be a bonus opportunity involving radians. 

## Circle Questions 

Pick 2 points A and B on a circle. 

![](img/img74.png)

1. How many (minor) central angles go through A, B? 

      One. 
      
![](img/img75.png)

2. How many inscribed angles go through A B? 

      A lot. 
      
      
3. Relationship between minor angle and inscribed angle? 

    The minor angle is twice the size of the inscribed angle.

### Extra Credit 

Figure out whats wrong with the theorem below and correct it: 

**Inscribed Angles Theorem** Let P, A and B be points on a circle with cnter 0, and let Q be a point on the circle that is not an arc APB. Then $\angle APC$ is one half the measure of the arc AQB. 

Note: you need to talk about length too, not just talk about angles.

### Homework 4 

Will allow corrections on HW 4 up until next Wednesday. 

Interesting strategy for 1 was to have case 1: right triangle (only 1 rectangle), case 2: general triangle (has two right triangles within it). 

This is a useful proof strategy. 

If you are using that the bisectors or a rhombus are perpendicular you need to state where we proved that in class or in another homework. 

### Circle Theorem

![](img/img77.png)

Conjecture: $m\angle AOB= 2 m\angle APB$

### (6.1) Inscribed Angle Theorem

![](img/img78.png)

Suppose A , B on a circle with center O and P is a point on a circle not in interior of $\angle AOB$ then $m\angle AOB=2m\angle APB$ (central = 2 inscribed)

**Case 1:** Right Central Angle 

![](img/img79.png)

The radius of the circle forms triangles with the same side lengths, because the sides are the radius (which remains the same). So, $\overline{AO}=\overline{BO}=\overline{PO}$ and $m\angle APO = m\angle PAO$

We also know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle adds up to $180\circ$, therefore $90^\circ = m\angle AOB= 2m\angle APB$. 

**Case 2:**

![](img/img80.png)

central = $m\angle 1 + m\angle 2$

inscribed = $m\angle 3 + m\angle 4$

From Case 1, we know that $m\angle 1 = 2m\angle 3$ and $m\angle 2 = 2m\angle 4$. 

Therefore $m\angle 1+m\angle 2 = 2m\angle 3+ 2m\angle 4=2(m\angle 3+\angle 4)$. 

Meaning our Central angle is 2 times the inscribed angle. 

**Case 3:** 

![](img/img81.png)

$\angle$ 1: inscribed angle 

$\angle$ 2: central angle 

Notice that $m\angle 3 = 2m\angle 4$. 

Also that $m\angle 2 + m\angle 3$ is a central angle, and $m\angle 1 +m\angle 4$ is inscribed. Meaning then that $m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = 2(m\angle 1 + m\angle 4)$. 

We can then show,

$m\angle 2 + m\angle 3 = 2(m\angle 1 + m\angle 4)$

$m\angle 2 + 2m\angle 4 = 2m\angle 1 + 2m\angle 4$

$m\angle 2 = 2 m\angle 1$

Summary 

![](img/img82.png)

### Corollary

Any two inscribed angles have the same arc on the circle are congruent. 

![](img/img83.png)

### Power of the Point Theorem 1

(6.6) Power of a Point 1. 

![](img/img84.png)

If $\overline{AB}$ and $\overline{CD}$ are chords of circle intersecting in x inside circle. Then $AX\cdot XB = CX\cdot XD$. 

Proof: 

![](img/img86.png)

By Inscribed Angle Corollary we see that $\angle 1 \cong \angle 2$ because they share the same arc on the circle. 

By Vertical Angle Theorem we can say that $\angle 3 \cong \angle 4$. 

By Inscribed Angle Theorem $\angle 5 \cong \angle 6$. We can also say that both triangles need to add up to $180\circ$, and therefore they are congruent. 

Therefore by AA Similarity Theorem $\traingle AXD \sim\triangle CXB$.

Since these two triangles are similar we know these two triangles are proportional (Don't know scaling factor k). 

$AX=KCX$

$XD=KXB$

$\frac{AX}{XD}=\frac{kCX}{kXB}=\frac{CX}{XB}$

$\frac{AX}{XD}=\frac{CX}{XB}$

(Get rid of fractions)

$AX\cdot XB=CX\cdot XD$

$\square$

### Power of a point II Theorem

P is outside of a circle, and draw 2 rays from P: 

1 intersecting A and then B

2 intersects C and D. 

Then, $PA\cdot PB= PC\cdot PD$. 

(Note: If P were X insides the circle then this is I)

Hint: Order matters, and drawing triangles will help (see image below). 

![](img/img87.png)

By AA similarity $\triangle PCB \sim \triangle PAD$. 

$\frac{PC}{PB}=\frac{PA}{PD}$ (cross multiply : butterfly diagnolization)

$PA=kPC$ and $PD=kPB$

$PA\cdot PB=PC\cdot PD$. 

$\square$.

This is the end of Euclidean Geometry.

### HW 5 Problem 3

![](img/img88.png)

Can't assume pink line C'B' is parallel to CB. 

1 option: SAS $\Rightarrow$ $\triangle ABC\sim A'B'C'\Rightarrow B'C'=kBC$.

### HW 6

For 1 and 2, inscribed angle theorem (or it's corallary).

For 3, even though we didn't prove it, using Boyce 6.5 (Lemma) will make this problem very easy. You also get to pick two more points on the circle. 

Note: A lemma is a piece of a theorem you prove first. 

## Analytic Geometry 

Axiomatic Geometry: Start with axioms $\rightarrow$ theorems. 

Analytic Geometry: Coordinates and functions. 

Preview: Euclids parallel lines $\rightarrow$ don't intersect. 

Q: What if space isn't flat? i.e. Earth 

- longitude (parallel that intersect)

- On a sphere angles in a triangle don't add to $180^\circ$. 

## Isometries as Functions 

Isometries: rotations, reflections, and translations that preserve distance, length, and angle measure. "rigid motion" 

Isometries as functions,  

In the plane: $F:\mathbb{R^2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$

$F((x,y))=(z,w)$

Domain: $\mathbb{R}^2$ 

Range: $\mathbb{R}^2$ (can plug in anything and doesn't leave anything out)

Ex: (Not Isometry) $F(x,y)=(\frac{1}{x},\frac{1}{y})$

Domain: anything with a zero is not in the domain or range. 

Ex: (Not Isometry) $F(x,y)=(2x,2y)$

Domain = Range = $\mathbb{R}^2$

However this does not preserve distance. 

### One-to-one

one-to-one: no two things in the domain get sent to the range. 

If $F(x,y)=F(z,w)$ then $(x,y)=(z,w)$

Conjecture: Isometries are one-to-one. 

Proof by contradiction. 

Imagine $(x,y)\ne (z,w)$ by $F(x,y)=F(z,w)$. 

If $F(x,y)=F(z,w)$ the distance from $F(x,y)$ to $F(z,w)$ is 0. But the distance from $(x,y)$ to $(z,w)$ wasn't 0. 

### Onto

Hit's everything in the codomain. 

$F:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ 

Everything in the codomain (Range) has to get sent back to the domain. 

Range = $\mathbb{R}^2$. 

Isometries are also onto! 

Bijection: one-to-one and onto 

### Isometries

Isometries = $\{F:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^2|\text{bijections that preserve distance and angle measure}\}$. 

$S=\{F:\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2|\text{bijections that preserve distance and angle measure}\}$

Set of Isometries

- translations

- rotations

- reflections 

- and "compositions" (doing one and then another)

### Activity 1: Classify Isometries

Classify each of the folloing as a translation ,rotation, reflection, or none of the above. 

1. $F(x,y)=(x,-y)$: Reflection across x

2. $G(x,y)=(y,x)$: Reflection across f(x)=-x

3. $H(x,y)=(x-1,y+2)$: Translation 

4. $J(x,y)=(2x,y)$: Not an isometry

## Fixed Point Theorem Part 1

If F, an isometry, fixes points A and B, then F fixes all points on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$. 

(once you fix two points, you fix every point on that line)

Explanation: $A=(x,y)$

F fixes A $\Rightarrow F(x,y)=(x,y)$

Proof: Suppose A, B are fixed by isometry F. F fixes all points on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$. Let C be on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$. 

Wherever $F(C)$ is, 

- $m\angle ACB=180^\circ\text{ or }0^\circ$

- $m\angle F(A)F(C)F(B)=180^\circ\text{ or }0^\circ$

$\rightarrow F(C)$ is on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.

Also $F(C)A=CA$ and $F(C)B=CB$

There are exactly 2 points on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$ with distance CA from A: 

- one has distance > BA

- one has distance < BA 

So they're different so only 1 is dist CB from B. So $F(C)=C$.

F fixes all points on $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$. 

Picture: 

![](img/img89.png)

This whole thing fails if A=B, then there is no line $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$.
