## Dilation 

Pick a center P, and "scaling factor" k. 

### Three cases 

for k>0

- k > 1 , expanding 

- k < 1 , shrinking 

- k = 1 nothing 

Q goes to $Q'$ on $\overrightarrow{PQ}$ where $\overline{PQ'}=k\overline{PQ}$.

- stays on same ray 

### Does Dilation Change Angles

No. When you scale from a center your angles stay the same (with congruent measures). 

Morale: Scale / Dilate using vertex of angle as center, angles don't change. 

## Similar

Two figures are similar if one can be superimposed on the other by a dilation and then an isometry. 

When things are similar then they are also proportional 

Notation: $\sim$

### Theorem: (AA Similarty Theorem)

If $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ satisfy 

- $\angle ABC\cong \angle DEF$ and 

- $\angle BCA\cong \angle EFD$

Then $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$
  
Note: $\angle CAB\cong \angle FDE$ is automatically true (AAA)

### Proof

Let ABC and DEF be triangles with $\angle BAC \cong \angle EDF$.

First: AB, DE > 0 

Apply dilation to $\triangle ABC$

- center = A

(note math is easier if you pick a point on the triangle ABC)

- scale factor = $k=\frac{DE}{AB}$

A'= A (doesn't move if it is the center)

B'=  $\rightarrow$ $AB'=k\cdot AB=DE$

Plan: If $\triangle A'B'C'\cong\triangle DEF$ then $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$.

We think $\overline{AB}$ is parallel to $\overline{B'C'}$ so $\angle AB'C'\cong \angle ABC$ (corresponding). 

By ASA we know $\triangle A'B'C'\cong\triangle DEF$, therefore $\triangle ABC\sim \triangle DEF$.

## Theorem: SAS Similarity Theorem

If $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ satisy 

- $\angle CAB\cong \angle FDE$ and 

- $\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{AC}{DF}$

then $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$. 

Proof: 

1. Dilation (pick center k)

2. Congruence Theorem 

Imagine a center point P, and two points A and B. 

It makes sense that if you dilate A to A' and B to B' then $\angle ABC\cong \angle A'PB'$ because they are stayingon the same rays. 

Similarly we can say $\angle PBA\cong \angle PB'A'$. 

Imagine we did a translation moving A, B by $\overrightarrow{BB'}$. 

- P stays on $\overleftrightarrow{BB'}$

We know that A'' is from the translation, and we know that that is an isometry which preserves angle and length. Therefore then angles are the same.

# Circles 

(Section 6 of Boyce notes)

**Circle:** center, radius 

Points on circle have distance r from the center point O. 

**Unit Circle:** radius length 1.

**Arc:** a connected subset of the points on circle.

**Chord:** line segment connecting 2 points on circle. 

**Central Angle:** vertex is center of circle, rays intersect in 2 different points.

![](img/img72.png)

$\angle HGI$ is a central angle. 

**Inscribed Angles** vertex is on circle, rays intersect circle in 2 points. 

![](img/img73.png)

$\angle LKM$ is an inscribed angle 

**Inscribed:** verities on circle. 

For an inscribed square, all four points of a square are on the circle.

**Tangent Line:** Line that intersects circle at only 1 point. 

**Radian:** measure of the central angle in a unit circle with arc length of 1. 

There will be a bonus opportunity involving radians. 

## Circle Questions 

Pick 2 points A and B on a circle. 

![](img/img74.png)

1. How many (minor) central angles go through A, B? 

      One. 
      
![](img/img75.png)

2. How many inscribed angles go through A B? 

      A lot. 
      
      
3. Relationship between minor angle and inscribed angle? 

    The minor angle is twice the size of the inscribed angle.

### Extra Credit 

Figure out whats wrong with the theorem below and correct it: 

**Inscribed Angles Theorem** Let P, A and B be points on a circle with cnter 0, and let Q be a point on the circle that is not an arc APB. Then $\angle APC$ is one half the measure of the arc AQB. 

Note: you need to talk about length too, not just talk about angles.
